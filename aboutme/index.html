   <h2>Carter Baumgart</h2>
   <p>Hey! It's great to meet y'all! As an introduction I am from Suwanee GA and I am studying Business Analytics! I am 24 and still single but hey, what's the rush, right?</p>
   <p>A little more about me, I love to travel and backpack which has resulted in me taking a lot of my classes online and working remote. This year I am in Utah and I am planning a trip to Europe for Christmas!</p>
   <p>I am taking this course because I really enjoy learning about the various aspects of computers and the internet and I am sure I will find many useful applications for the skills I will learn here. I am excited to learn with y'all this semester! Let's have a blast! </p>
